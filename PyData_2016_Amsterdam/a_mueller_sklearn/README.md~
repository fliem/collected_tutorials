It is recommended that you update the materials before the course, as they
might change in the days leading up to the conference.


Please bring a laptop with a working installation of Python (2.7, 3.4 or 3.5).
The following packages are required:

- scikit-learn >= 0.16
- matplotlib >= 1.3
- numpy >= 1.5
- IPython >= 4.0
- Jupyter Notebook >= 4.0

The easiest way to install all requirements is to install the free Anaconda Python distribution:

Please download the material prior to arriving to the tutorial, and make sure
you can run the notebooks.  To run a notebook, start Jupyter Notebook and
browse to the folder to which you downloaded it.
